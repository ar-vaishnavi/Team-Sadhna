   <p> ANGANWADI</p>
    <h3>Anganwadi is a type of rural child care centre in India.It was started by the Indian government in 1975 as part of the Integrated Child Development Services program to combat child hunger and malnutrition. 
        Anganwadi in Hindi means "courtyard shelter" in English.
        Anganwadis predominantly serve children aged 0-6 years. <br>
        While they form an integral part of the Indian public health care system, 
        their contribution extends far beyond healthcare, 
        having a substantial impact on children early education and holistic development.<br>
        The critical role played by Anganwadi centers in facilitating various child development activities cannot be overstated. They provide accessible and affordable healthcare, with workers offering valuable insights into local health concerns and potential solutions. Their deep connections with the community enhance their communication effectiveness regarding community programs.</h3>
